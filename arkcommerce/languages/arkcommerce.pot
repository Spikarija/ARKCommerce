"In a sea of carbon copies among crypto currencies, ARK stands out for "
"providing the users, developers, and startups with innovative blockchain "
"technologies aiming to create an entire ecosystem of linked chains and a "
"virtual spiderweb of endless use-cases that make it highly flexible, "
"adaptable, and scalable. Having launched in late March 2017, it has gained "
"many supporters for its DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) blockchain securing "
"mechanism as a green alternative to traditional PoW (Proof of Work) cryto "
"currencies, one that enables much faster and less expensive execution of "
"transactions, and one that lends itself well to processing automation. A big "
"win for ARK is its inherent system of governance through user voting with "
"their wallet balances for delegates where the best of them get rewarded with "
"loyalty, longevity, and profit sharing whereas bad actors or low-performance "
"delegates eventually get kicked out of the top 51 forging delegates. These "
"are the only ones that actually \"mine\" ARK blockchain, receive transaction "
"fees, and reap the rewards (2 ARK per block) stemming from it. As a "
"currency, ARK features a modest inflation rate which makes it suitable as a "
"long-term hold."

"The roadmap for future development is very ambitious for the steadily "

"coming integrations of IPFS (Interplanetary File System) and IPDB "
"(Interplanetary Database) transactions, push-button deployable blockchains, "
"a distributed token exchange, and so on. From this standpoint, ARK is poised "
"to become one of the top contenders for crypto currency throne in the "
"future. The user base and the development ecosystem that has sprung up "
"around ARK is truly fruitful and dedicated, which makes the success of the "
"entire project that much more likely."
