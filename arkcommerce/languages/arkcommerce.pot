#: arkcommercegui.php:830
msgid ""
"In a sea of carbon copies among crypto currencies, ARK stands out for "
"providing the users, developers, and startups with innovative blockchain "
"technologies aiming to create an entire ecosystem of linked chains and a "
"virtual spiderweb of endless use-cases that make it highly flexible, "
"adaptable, and scalable. Having launched in late March 2017, it has gained "
"many supporters for its DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) blockchain securing "
"mechanism as a green alternative to traditional PoW (Proof of Work) cryto "
"currencies, one that enables much faster and less expensive execution of "
"transactions, and one that lends itself well to processing automation. A big "
"win for ARK is its inherent system of governance through user voting with "
"their wallet balances for delegates where the best of them get rewarded with "
"loyalty, longevity, and profit sharing whereas bad actors or low-performance "
"delegates eventually get kicked out of the top 51 forging delegates. These "
"are the only ones that actually \"mine\" ARK blockchain, receive transaction "
"fees, and reap the rewards (2 ARK per block) stemming from it. As a "
"currency, ARK features a modest inflation rate which makes it suitable as a "
"long-term hold."
msgstr ""

#: arkcommercegui.php:833
msgid ""
"The roadmap for future development is very ambitious for the steadily "
"growing and capable team behind it intends to incorporate various features "
"like ArkVM (Virtual Machine) such as the one found in Ethereum, as well as "
"coming integrations of IPFS (Interplanetary File System) and IPDB "
"(Interplanetary Database) transactions, push-button deployable blockchains, "
"a distributed token exchange, and so on. From this standpoint, ARK is poised "
"to become one of the top contenders for crypto currency throne in the "
"future. The user base and the development ecosystem that has sprung up "
"around ARK is truly fruitful and dedicated, which makes the success of the "
"entire project that much more likely."

msgid ""
"ARKCommerce is a payment gateway that provides crypto currency payment "
"services for WooCommerce store operators on WordPress platform by utilizing "
"the ARK blockchain. Fully based on open source code and architecture, "
"ARKCommerce aims to provide the necessary e-commerce infrastructure with the "
"goal of wider market acceptance for ARK by both customers and merchants. "
"Online merchants struggle with risk-free and timely digital product delivery "
"via established fiat currency payment intermediaries. This makes for a "
"particularly suitable use case for crypto currency payments that happen in "
"trustless, straightforward, and automated fashion."

"ARKCommerce leverages the versatility, resilience and quickness of the ARK "
"blockchain that features a special field called SmartBridge which enables "
"user input as part of the transaction, whereas 8 second block times "
"facilitate prompt transaction confirmations. All orders placed through "
"ARKCommerce are placed on-hold until repetitive ARK blockchain queries for "
"open orders reveal a transaction for an appropriate amount of ARK and with a "
"correct order reference making a deposit into the monitored ARK wallet "
"address belonging to the store, all without requiring or storing wallet "
"passphrases."
